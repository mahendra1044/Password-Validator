✅ 2. ⚙️ Integration Steps
Place all three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) in the same directory.

Ensure your environment supports basic HTML/JS/CSS (no backend dependencies).

Open index.html in any browser.

Integrate into your existing application by including the style.css in your <head> and script.js at the end of <body> (or in your JS bundle).
